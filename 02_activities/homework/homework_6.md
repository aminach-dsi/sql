**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous work, I realize that while I have focused on developing accurate and reliable models, I have not always considered the ethical implications of my work. The increasing importance of data ethics issues, as discussed in the last learning session, has made me aware of the need to incorporate ethics and inequity components into my work.

As an actuary, I have access to sensitive data, including medical records and financial statements. I now understand that I must actively consider the potential impact of my models on diverse populations and vulnerable groups, and ensure that my work does not perpetuate existing inequities. To achieve this, I will make sure that the data I use is collected fairly and does not reinforce existing biases. 

Additionally, I will ensure that my models and recommendations prioritize the protection of sensitive data, and that I have the necessary consent to access and use this data.

Finally, I will regularly reflect on my work and its potential impact, and engage in ongoing education and training to stay current with best practices in data ethics and inequity.
